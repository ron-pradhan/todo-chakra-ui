Todo App

A todo app developed using ReactJS and Chakra UI is a web application that allows users to manage their tasks and organize their daily activities in a simple and intuitive manner. Users can create new tasks and delete tasks that are no longer needed. It also allows users to switch background colour from light mode to dark mode and vice-versa.
